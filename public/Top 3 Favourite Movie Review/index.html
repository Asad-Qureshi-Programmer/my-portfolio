<h2>My Top 3 Favourite Anime Movies</h2>
<hr />

<h3>1) Your Name</h3>
<h4>Director- Makoto Shinkai</h4>
<p>This anime movie makes non-anime viewers fall in love with anime movies. It's perfect blend of all the emotions. This story depicts "Love in Destiny" very beautifully.</p>
<h3>2) Suzume no Tojimari</h3>
<h4>Director- Makoto Shinkai</h4>
<p>Like always, Makoto Shinkai movies has the best quality. The realistic anime with mixture of emotions, actions and suspense is what makes it my 2nd favourite anime movie.</p>

<h3>3) Weathering With you</h3>
<h4>Director- Makoto Shinkai</h4>
<p>Completely Opposite to "Your name", here the lovers fight for their love, even though it's not in their destiny. Very Emotional as well as Heart Touching Story</p>
